Topics Covered:
- Basic IO
- Arithmetic Operators
- Assignment Operators
- For Loops
- If else
- Increment and Decrement
- While loop
- Break and Continue

Key Points:
- while { break (assuming its inside the bracket while dominates) } = stops/jumps to a higher hierarchy outside the bracket.
- while { continue (assuming its inside the bracket while dominates) }= loops the program inside the bracket.
- Note that break and continue are always in the if, else if, else when a selection to loop/stop is made from user input.

Break vs. repeat = false:
- Break will take you elsewhere.
- Meanwhile setting the while to false will take you back, giving you a chance to try again after a wrong input.
- E.g. when you have wrong input, break will take you away from to calc and send u to the main menum while = false will stay in the user question.
